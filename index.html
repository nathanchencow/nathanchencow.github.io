    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Hobbies/Interests:</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Video Editing, VFX and Content Creation</h3>

    <p style="text-align: center;">In my free time, I like utilizing video editing software like Premiere Pro and After Effects to create videos on  YouTube. I not only do it for fun, but I also do it as a part-time job! I have around 3 YouTube play buttons, and I have been doing this since my sophomore year of high school!</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Gym, Health and Running</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I not only like going to the gym (I go at least 5x a week), but I also love running and finding fun new activities to do! I really value my health, and one of the biggest things I've been trying to do is to eat out less and cook things at my apartment more!</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">AI and ML</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In terms of technical concepts, I love learning about AI and ML. I'm actively involved in AI projects and finding ways to utilize this technology to increase my workflow efficiency, and also just gain a better understanding of this technology. I've recently created an AI Agent that helps speed up some of the scripting I do for my YouTube videos! </p>
